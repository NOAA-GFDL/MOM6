  real :: asx ! The absolute value of x rescaled by an integer power of 8 to put it into

  real :: root_asx ! The cube root of asx [B]

              ! of the cube root of asx in arbitrary units that can grow or shrink with each iteration [B D]
  real :: den_prev ! The denominator of an expression for the previous iteration of the evolving estimate of
              ! the cube root of asx in arbitrary units that can grow or shrink with each iteration [D]
  integer :: ex_3 ! One third of the exponent part of x, used to rescale x to get a.

    !   Iteratively determine root_asx = asx**1/3 using Halley's method and then Newton's method,
    ! noting that Halley's method onverges monotonically and needs no bounding.  Halley's method is
    ! slightly more complicated that Newton's method, but converges in a third fewer iterations.
    !   Keeping the estimates in a fractional form Root = num / den allows this calculation with
    ! no real divisions during the iterations before doing a single real division at the end,
    ! and it is therefore more computationally efficient.

    ! This first estimate gives the same magnitude of errors for 0.125 and 1.0 after two iterations.
    ! The first iteration is applied explicitly.

      ! Halley's method iterates estimates as Root = Root * (Root**3 + 2.*asx) / (2.*Root**3 + asx).
      num_prev = num ; den_prev = den
      num = num_prev * (num_prev**3 + 2.0 * asx * (den_prev**3))
      den = den_prev * (2.0 * num_prev**3 + asx * (den_prev**3))
      ! Equivalent to:  root_asx = root_asx * (root_asx**3 + 2.*asx) / (2.*root_asx**3 + asx)
    enddo
    ! At this point the error in root_asx is better than 1 part in 3e14.
    root_asx = num / den

    ! One final iteration with Newton's method polishes up the root and gives a solution
    ! that is within the last bit of the true solution.
