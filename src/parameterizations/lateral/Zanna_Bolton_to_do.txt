1. Parameter fetching.
Each module defines control structure, containing the following information:
- Parameterizations state (if exist, see MOM_MEKE_types.F90)
- All parameters
- is turn on or turn off
- flag "initialized"
- pointer to type(diag_ctrl)
- Diagnostic handles, like "integer :: id_MEKE = -1"

This control structure is allocated in 
MOM.F90, see type(MEKE_CS) and type(thickness_diffuse_CS)

Parameters are defined in _init subroutine. 
- It reads whether parameterisation works and stores it in control structure,
see CS%thickness_diffuse in MOM_thickness_diffuse.F90
- if CS%thickness_diffuse == False, subroutine returns
- Reads all needed parameters with get_param. Parameter need not to be declared elsewhere.

Init function is USUALLY (except of hor_visc_init) called in MOM.F90:
see MEKE_init, thickness_diffuse_init

Fields are offered for output with function register_diag_field
Fields are sended to output with  call post_data(CS%id_Ue, tmp, CS%diag). 
This function requires id_Ue and diag in control structure
Diagnostic fields are 3D stack variables. They are collected in 3D loop.
